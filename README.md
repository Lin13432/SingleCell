# SingleCell

In this study, the .ipynb file includes all analysis of a single-cell RNA-seq dataset. I start from a count matrix, perform data normalization, filtering, PCA, clustering, cluster annotation (e.g., using marker genes), and differential expression (marker genes), and functional analysis on at least one cluster/cell type.

In the .ipynb file, I describe the dataset (provide links to the data source), and introduce the biological system. Explain my results using markdown cells, track my control genes, and paste screenshots of external tools (e.g. IGV, gProfiler, Cytoscape, UCSC, etc) in markdown cells, and end with a conclusion.
